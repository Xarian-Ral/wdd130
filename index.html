    <p>Hullo. I'm Xander Wilcox. But the drawing up there is a fictional character of mine, Xarian!
      I currently live in Munds Park, Arizona, but moved from Washington state. I enjoy music composition involving orchestral or instrumental type tracks, even with some synthy type things or even orchestral blended with rock. I'm currently attempting to learn art on my own and beginning 3D animation, and am an avid video editor. I also happen to love fighting games. A LOT.

    <p>Arizona is known for its red rock formations, warm deserts, and famous landmarks like the Grand Canyon. It’s a great place for adventure and breathtaking scenery. Shame I don't like going there much though.</p>
